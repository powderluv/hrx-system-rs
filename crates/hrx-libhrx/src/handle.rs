//! The single audited boundary between the public C ABI's opaque handles and the
//! Rust-owned objects behind them.
//!
//! A handle is the data pointer of a `std::sync::Arc<T>` (so the C ABI still sees
//! a plain `*mut hrx_X_s`, and field access is a single deref — no extra
//! indirection). `retain`/`release` become `Arc` refcount operations, which use
//! the same atomic increment/decrement as the old hand-rolled `AtomicI32`
//! refcount, and the object's `Drop` runs the IREE/parent teardown exactly once
//! on the last release. This replaces manual `libc::calloc`/`free` +
//! `iree_*_retain`/`release` accounting with compiler-enforced ownership, while
//! keeping the C-visible behavior (and performance) identical.
//!
//! Every `unsafe` here trusts a caller-provided handle — which is inherent to a C
//! ABI (C callers can always pass garbage). It is confined to this module so the
//! migrated business logic stays safe Rust.
